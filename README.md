# Cricket Analysis

## Overview
The Cricket Analysis project utilizes Power BI for data visualization and analysis of cricket statistics. Data is collected through web scraping using Python and Google Colab IPython notebooks. The scraped data includes player information, match data, batting stats, and bowling stats, which are then stored in JSON format and converted to CSV files for easy handling.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Python scripts are used to scrape data from cricket websites, gathering player and match statistics.
- **Data Transformation**: The scraped data is converted from JSON to CSV format for compatibility with Power BI.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard provides users with interactive visualizations and analysis tools.
- **Batting Stats**: Visualizations and analysis of batting statistics for individual players and teams.
- **Bowling Stats**: Analysis of bowling performance, including economy rates, wickets taken, and more.
- **Power Hitter Players**: Identification and visualization of players with exceptional batting strike rates.
- **All-Rounder Stats**: Insights into players who excel in both batting and bowling aspects.
- **Dream Team of 11**: A curated selection of the top-performing players based on various statistical metrics.
